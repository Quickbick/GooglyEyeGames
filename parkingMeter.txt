Robert Ulysses~Hey, I don’t know if you noticed but I’m kind of the main character around here.~Anything I say goes.~Staying here at this post has really been pissing me off, I’ve been missing my regular donut routine.~I’m the only officer on this island, without me this island wouldn't be so familiar with the feeling of safety and security they've come to expect.~I can’t wait to get promoted off this post, hell maybe even off this island. All I have to do… All you have to do! Is find the killer!
